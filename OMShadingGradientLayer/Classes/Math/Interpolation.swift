    // Cubic interpolation is the simplest method that offers true continuity between the segments.
    // As such it requires more than just the two endpoints of the segment but also the two points on either side of them.
    // So the function requires 4 points in all labeled y0, y1, y2, and y3, in the code below. mu still behaves the same way for interpolating
    // between the segment y1 to y2.
    // This does raise issues for how to interpolate between the first and last segments.
    // In the examples here I just haven't bothered. A common solution is the dream up two extra points at the start and end of the sequence,
    // the new points are created so that they have a slope equal to the slope of the start or end segment.
